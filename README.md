My attempt at building and shipping a CLI to-do list with the help of a tutorial.

What it does:
- Add tasks
- Views tasks
- Marks tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Exit from app

Features I added myself:
- 

Features I want to add:
- 

How to install/use:

What I learnt:
- How to structure a program using clean, modular code instead of dumping everything in one massive file.
- Understanding how a central main.py runs the show by calling functions from other files, and how each file handles its own responsibility.
- How functions actually work in real apps — they don’t need to be long, fancy, or complex. Their entire purpose is to do one job and be reused.
- The difference between parameters (inside the parentheses) and arguments (the actual values passed in).
- How to pass data (like the tasks list) between functions so they can all work together.
- .append(), .pop(), len(), input()
- That I can use "pass" as a placeholder when planning out functions.
- How loops and user input connect everything to create an interactive tool.
- Parameter = “what the function EXPECTS.” (when you define a function)
- Argument = “what the function GETS.” (when you call a function)
